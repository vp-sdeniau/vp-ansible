# To assign a password, here is a way to create the password. 
# This will require the passlib library to be installed: sudo yum install python-passlib
#   At a command line prompt run:
#     python -c "from passlib.hash import sha512_crypt; import getpass; print sha512_crypt.encrypt(getpass.getpass())"
#   Take the value that is returned and paste it inbetween the single quotes below. Example:
#     password: 'secret'
# If setup_home is set to true, will use the values of shell and home when creating the user
